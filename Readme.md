## Utils

* [Cerebro](http://github.com/KELiON/cerebro) – Cerebro Main App
* [YTS - YIFY Official Website](https://yts.ag) – Here you will be able to browse and download YIFY movies in excellent 720p, 1080p and 3D quality, all at the smallest file size. Only here: YTS Movies Torrents.

## Extras
* I don't have relation with YIFY or YTS webpage. I get the data throught their api. [Documentation](https://yts.ag/api)
* The `yts` command was replace to `ymovie` because YouTube plugin recognize and match with `yts` term (maybe is an issue).
